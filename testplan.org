* Test plan

Before doing a production release we need to check that all
functionality still works.  This plan contains actions to do that,
that have to be done on Firefox, Chrome, Edge on PC and on a mobile
phone. The Django admin configuration parts can be done on a single
browser as Django itself is well-tested and there won't be browser
differences with that.

When a bug is found, it will be added to the issue tracker and fixed
in a later release. At that point a test for that bug will also be
added to this plan, to make sure that a regression doesn't occur.

On the staging server not all required data is always available. There
is no solution yet for this problem.  For now we can't do more than
test what we can on staging, then do a production release and
immediately run these tests there; that is clearly not ideal, but at
the time of writing the system isn't deployed yet and this problem
should be solveable in the future.

* Configuration

The configuration is entered into the Django admin as JSON, in a
"ClientConfiguration". There is currently only a single one of these
on each server.

As the JSON isn't formatted, it is recommended to copy and paste it to
and from a JSON editor that can format it.

After changing the configuration, *refresh* the client so that it uses
the new data.

*** Set the time period

When no period is configured, charts should retrieve data from 24
hours before now to 12 hours after now.

This can be changed by adding or changing the property "periodHoursRelativeToNow" to
the configuration, e.g.

    {
       "tiles": [...],
       "periodHoursRelativeToNow": [-100, 100]
    }

Sets it to 100 hours before now to 100 hours after. Test this with a timeseries chart,
then restore the old value of the configuration.

* Terms screen

The Terms and Condition screen should be shown on each new visit to the site and after
every refresh of the client.

* Application screens

There is an overview page, a settings screen and a "fullscreen mode" for when a tile is selected.

Check that these work on large screens as well as small ones by making
a fullscreen browser window very small.

* Settings screen

Change the map background.

Change the time used as "Now".

* Tiles

For each tile there are three versions:

- On the opening screen

- In "fullscreen mode" when the tile is selected

- On a sufficiently large screen, to the left of the selected tile in
  the "PowerPoint view".

** Water depth map

All tiles behave the same; it should show a water depth raster on the map.

Open the Legend and see if its values make sense, then close it.

** Assets map

Should show a marker for each measuringstation on the map, as well as
each configured point.

Markers are green with a tick mark by default; markers that have an
active alarm are red with a warning sign. This can't be tested yet as
there are no alarms configured.

Clicking on a marker of a measuring station should show a list of its timeseries
with their latest values. Clicking on a marker of a point should only show its description.

In both cases, if a timeseries chart tile exists that contains a
timeseries or the same point on a raster, a button should be shown
that selects that tile. Currently not configured yet.

** Alarms


** External pages

These can fail for several reasons; check that the tile opens
correctly and that the external page is visible.

** Timeseries charts

Currently, a timeseries chart is expected for the period around "now".

Water depths are also configured, but only for 10 and 11
june, 1991. When the "configured Now" is changed to then, a chart
should show.

On the fullscreen tile:

- Y axes should show the units of each chart

- In the topleft corner, a legend should show for each chart that has data in the current period

- Charts can be turned on and off by clicking in the legend

- It is possible to zoom by dragging the mouse over some part of the data

- It is possible to create an image of the current chart using the tools in the top right

On the front page tile:

- No interaction is possible

- There is no legend

On the PowerPoint tile:

- No labels and ticks are shown either
