Development

A pre-commit hook is configured to run [Prettier.js](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) every time, so the codebase stays in consistent form, style-wise.

Internationalisation
====================

This client has l10n/i18n support via react-intl.
English is the default/fallback language.

To extract translation tags to the i18n catalog: `$ yarn run i18n:extract`.
To update the language catalogs: `$ yarn run i18n:update`

To execute both subsequently, run: `$ yarn run i18n:extract-then-update`.

See `src/translations/locales/[language].json`. (where language is 'nl', for now)


Redux
=====

Uses lizard-api-client for XHR calls to the back-end and returns Immutable.js datastructures.
See actions.js and reducers.js.


React-router
============

There are two routes:

- "/" - renders the grid layout
- "/full/:id" - renders the detail page of a tile
