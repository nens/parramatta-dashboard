        <h1 className={styles.header}>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p>
          Use of the FloodSmart Parramatta System is subject to the terms and
          conditions set out below. If you proceed to use the FloodSmart
          Parramatta System, your use will be taken as acceptance of these terms
          and conditions.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The FloodSmart Parramatta System is provided by City of Parramatta
            Council (Council), as part of a collaborative project between
            Council, Sydney Water Corporation, NSW State Emergency Services and
            Office for Environment and Heritage (together the Project Group).
          </li>
          <li>
            The FloodSmart Parramatta System intends to provide catchment, river
            and rain gauge, modelling and forecast data for information during a
            flood event. The FloodSmart Parramatta System will also provide
            automated alerts to warn of potential flood risk.
          </li>
          <li>
            While Council will use reasonable endeavours to ensure that the data
            is provided at the earliest opportunity and is fit for purpose, the
            FloodSmart Parramatta System relies on third party data and predicts
            future events therefore reliability cannot be guaranteed. Use of the
            data contained in the FloodSmart Parramatta System for incident
            response is at the userâ€™s own risk.
          </li>
          <li>
            As the FloodSmart Parramatta System is subject to naturally
            occurring events, the Project Group does not warrant the accuracy
            and completeness of the information. The FloodSmart Parramatta
            System should not be solely relied upon. You are responsible for
            verifying the information provided by the FloodSmart Parramatta
            System and making your own independent assessment of the risks.
          </li>
          <li>
            While Council will use reasonable endeavours to ensure that any
            FloodSmart Parramatta System alerts are provided to you at the
            earliest opportunity, the FloodSmart Parramatta System relies on
            telecommunication networks to send alerts and the delivery of the
            alerts cannot be guaranteed.
          </li>
          <li>
            You acknowledge that you are using the FloodSmart Parramatta System
            and the data included within at your own risk. In consideration of

            System and to the extent permitted by law, you release each party in
            the Project Group in this respect (Release). This Release includes,
            but is not limited to, any loss or damage suffered, incurred or

                provision of an alert that warns of an event that fails to
